 * We chose the Apache 2.0 license first of all because we have no intent of making a profit
 * from this program. Secondly, we wanted this source code to be available to all for distribution
 * and available to modify. Lastly, we did not want a viral license because we wanted to give this
 * source code the greatest chance of reuse by other users and as such we thought that limiting
 * it to force any implementing program to also stay strictly open source would reduce that possibility.
